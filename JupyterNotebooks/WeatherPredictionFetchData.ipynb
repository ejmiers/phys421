    "\n",
    "1. Data collection and processing (i.e. like doing an experiment!)\n",

    "3. Using Neural Network models (i.e. a machine-learning approach)\n",

    "The data used will be collected from the WorldWeatherOnline API web services. We will interact with the API to pull in weather data over a given time period, for a given location.\n",

    "Once collected, the data will need to be processed and aggregated into a format that is suitable for data analysis, and then cleaned."
